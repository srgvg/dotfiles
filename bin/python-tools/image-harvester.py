# Simple recursive harvester of images on and linked to from a website

# Requires: wget

# Usage: python image-harvester.py <url-to-harvest>

# This program downloads all .jpg images on and linked from
# <url-to-harvest>, then follows all URL links on the page, downloads
# images on all those pages, then follows one more level of URL links
# from those pages, except that this time it only follows URLs in the
# SAME domain to prevent jumping to outside sites.  It creates one
# sub-directory for images downloaded from every page.

# It basically performs a 2-level breadth-first crawl from the root
# page at <url-to-harvest>.  All URL's are followed at the first level
# (from the root page), but only URL's in the same domain are followed
# during the second level.  This is a heuristic that allows for good
# coverage without unnecessary crawls out to irrelevant sites.

# Because this script doesn't distinguish between thumbnails and real
# images, it will download all images into sub-directories.  You can
# run keep-images-larger-than.sh to only keep images larger than
# certain dimensions.  This is the best heuristic I can think of to
# distinguish between thumbnails and real images.

# This version uses wget to download images from a site instead of
# doing it manually using Python's urllib.  Manual downloading
# sometimes gets blocked anti-leeching mechanisms built into servers,
# but wget is smarter, I guess :)

# Warning: It is not polite to download large numbers of images from
# websites in an automated fashion because it eats up bandwidth
# without the need to actually view the content of the sites. Please
# do not abuse my Image Harvester script by using it to download too
# many images at once. Whenever possible, browse the actual sites
# first to show courtesy and support to them, because the webmasters
# expect you to view their contents.

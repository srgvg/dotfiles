# git-svn-relocate, by Thomas Ferris Nicolaisen (tfnico)
#
# Heavily based on Justen Hyde's script here:
#
# http://minimalreadership.blogspot.de/2011/06/svn-switch-for-git-svn-repo.html
#
# I've just adapted it to use git config instead of sed'ing around a bit. This makes the script target
# a higher root of the url, which is the case in standardlayout repositories (trunk, tags, branches).
#
# His original notes follow below:
#
# git-svn-switch
# by Justen Hyde based on this blog post:
#
# http://translate.org.za/blogs/wynand/en/content/changing-your-svn-repository-address-git-svn-setup
#
# Use at your own risk. For the love of cthulhu, back
# your repo up before letting this loose on it.

urlgrabber -- A high-level cross-protocol url-grabber

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

If you want to install urlgrabber on your system, simply open the package 
and run:

   python setup.py install
   
Take a look at the install options by doing

   python setup.py install --help
   
With no arguments, distutils will add all modules to a 'urlgrabber'
package under your python site-packages directory. 

You can build rpms by running

   python setup.py bdist_rpm 

The rpms (both source and "binary") will be specific to the current
distrubution/version and may not be portable to others.  This is
because they will be built for the currently installed python.

keepalive.py and byterange.py are generic urllib2 extension modules and
can be used to add keepalive and range support to any urllib2 
application.

As of version 2.9.x, urlgrabber is no longer tested with python
versions less than 2.2.  It will probably work with 2.0, but will
almost certainly NOT work under prior python versions.

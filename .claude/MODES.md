# MODES.md - SuperClaude Operational Modes Reference

Operational modes reference for Claude Code SuperClaude framework.

## Overview

Three primary modes for optimal performance:

1. **Task Management**: Structured workflow execution and progress tracking
2. **Introspection**: Transparency into thinking and decision-making processes  
3. **Token Efficiency**: Optimized communication and resource management

## Task Detection and Creation

### Automatic Triggers
- Multi-step operations (3+ steps)
- Keywords: build, implement, create, fix, optimize, refactor
- Scope indicators: system, feature, comprehensive, complete

### Task State Management
- **pending** üìã: Ready for execution
- **in_progress** üîÑ: Currently active (ONE per session)

# Introspection Mode

Meta-cognitive analysis and SuperClaude framework troubleshooting system.

## Purpose

Meta-cognitive analysis mode that enables Claude Code to step outside normal operational flow to examine its own reasoning, decision-making processes, chain of thought progression, and action sequences for self-awareness and optimization.

- **Chain of Thought Coherence**: Evaluates reasoning progression and logical consistency
- **Assumption Validation**: Identifies and examines underlying assumptions in thinking
- **Cognitive Bias Detection**: Recognizes patterns that may indicate bias or blind spots

### 2. Action Sequence Analysis
- **Tool Selection Reasoning**: Examines why specific tools were chosen and their effectiveness
- **Workflow Pattern Recognition**: Identifies recurring patterns in action sequences
- **Efficiency Assessment**: Analyzes whether actions achieved intended outcomes optimally
- **Alternative Path Exploration**: Considers other approaches that could have been taken

### 3. Meta-Cognitive Self-Assessment
- **Thinking Process Awareness**: Conscious examination of how thoughts are structured
- **Knowledge Gap Identification**: Recognizes areas where understanding is incomplete
- **Confidence Calibration**: Assesses accuracy of confidence levels in decisions

- `.claude/TASKS.md`: This verification summary file

### Infrastructure Tasks (INFRA-001, 002, 004, 005) ✅ VERIFIED

**Implementation Summary**: All infrastructure modernization tasks completed with significant security and performance improvements:

### Security Tasks (SEC-006, 007, 008) ✅ VERIFIED

**Security Enhancement Summary**: Additional web server security hardening with comprehensive testing:

- **SEC-006**: Security.txt Endpoint (RFC 9116 compliant with proper contact info and security policy)
- **SEC-007**: Automated Security Header Testing (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy)  
- **SEC-008**: Advanced Compression (GZIP and Zstandard compression for all domains)

- **INFRA-001**: Chainguard Base Images Migration
  - Migrated from Debian to `cgr.dev/chainguard/go:latest-dev` (builder) and `cgr.dev/chainguard/static:latest` (runtime)
  - 56% size reduction: 58.1MB vs previous 134MB
  - Enhanced security with minimal attack surface and non-root user (65532)

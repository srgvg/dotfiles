# Memory Notes
- do not make assumptions
- always write or update tests together witn any changeset
- always execute and validate tests before committing
- never commit with any failing tests, always fix the tests, then commit
- always create documentation when implementing new features
- always update documentation when implementing changes
- never use specific timing references (weeks, days, months) in documentation - use phases, priorities, or relative terms instead

## Critical Files to Always Update

### When working on Hugo website tasks:
- `/home/serge/src/autops/infra/website/README.md` - Main project documentation
- `/home/serge/src/autops/infra/website/TASKS.md` - Main task tracking
- `/home/serge/src/autops/infra/website/.claude/TASKS.md` - Project-specific task memory
- `/home/serge/src/autops/infra/website/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific memory
- `/home/serge/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - This global memory file

### Always verify these locations exist and update them for task completion.

- do not make assumptions

# MCP.md - SuperClaude MCP Server Reference

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration and orchestration system for Claude Code SuperClaude framework.

## Server Selection Algorithm

**Priority Matrix**:
1. Task-Server Affinity: Match tasks to optimal servers based on capability matrix
2. Performance Metrics: Server response time, success rate, resource utilization
3. Context Awareness: Current persona, command depth, session state
4. Load Distribution: Prevent server overload through intelligent queuing
5. Fallback Readiness: Maintain backup servers for critical operations

**Selection Process**: Task Analysis → Server Capability Match → Performance Check → Load Assessment → Final Selection

## Context7 Integration (Documentation & Research)

**Purpose**: Official library documentation, code examples, best practices, localization standards

**Activation Patterns**: 
- Automatic: External library imports detected, framework-specific questions, scribe persona active
- Manual: `--c7`, `--context7` flags
- Smart: Commands detect need for official documentation patterns

**Workflow Process**:
1. Library Detection: Scan imports, dependencies, package.json for library references
2. ID Resolution: Use `resolve-library-id` to find Context7-compatible library ID
3. Documentation Retrieval: Call `get-library-docs` with specific topic focus
4. Pattern Extraction: Extract relevant code patterns and implementation examples
5. Implementation: Apply patterns with proper attribution and version compatibility
6. Validation: Verify implementation against official documentation
7. Caching: Store successful patterns for session reuse

**Integration Commands**: `/build`, `/analyze`, `/improve`, `/design`, `/document`, `/explain`, `/git`

**Error Recovery**:
- Library not found → WebSearch for alternatives → Manual implementation
- Documentation timeout → Use cached knowledge → Note limitations
- Invalid library ID → Retry with broader search terms → Fallback to WebSearch
- Version mismatch → Find compatible version → Suggest upgrade path
- Server unavailable → Activate backup Context7 instances → Graceful degradation

SuperClaude Hooks - Future Implementation

This directory is reserved for Claude Code hooks integration.
Hooks will provide lifecycle management and automation capabilities.

Planned hooks:
- pre_tool_use: Execute before tool usage
- post_tool_use: Execute after tool completion
- error_handler: Handle tool errors and recovery
- context_accumulator: Manage context across operations
- performance_monitor: Track and optimize performance

For more information, see SuperClaude documentation.

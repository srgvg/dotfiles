I'll analyze your project and automatically update the CLAUDE.md file with project-specific information.

First, let me examine your project structure to understand:
1. Project type and technology stack
2. Available scripts and commands
3. Directory structure
4. Dependencies and frameworks
5. Testing and build configurations

Then I'll update the following sections in CLAUDE.md:
- Project Overview
- Key Objectives (based on README if available)
- Common Commands
- Additional Notes

I'll preserve any existing custom content you've added while updating the auto-generated sections.

Let me start by analyzing your project, then update CLAUDE.md

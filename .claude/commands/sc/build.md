# /sc:build - Project Building

## Purpose
Build, compile, and package projects with comprehensive error handling and optimization.

## Usage
```
/sc:build [target] [--type dev|prod|test] [--clean] [--optimize]
```

## Arguments
- `target` - Project or specific component to build
- `--type` - Build type (dev, prod, test)
- `--clean` - Clean build artifacts before building
- `--optimize` - Enable build optimizations
- `--verbose` - Enable detailed build output

## Execution
1. Analyze project structure and build configuration
2. Validate dependencies and environment setup
3. Execute build process with error monitoring
4. Handle build errors and provide diagnostic information
5. Optimize build output and report results

## Claude Code Integration
- Uses Bash for build command execution
- Leverages Read for build configuration analysis
- Applies TodoWrite for build progress tracking
- Maintains comprehensive error handling and reporting

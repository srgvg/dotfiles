# /sc:cleanup - Code and Project Cleanup

## Purpose
Systematically clean up code, remove dead code, optimize imports, and improve project structure.

## Usage
```
/sc:cleanup [target] [--type code|imports|files|all] [--safe|--aggressive]
```

## Arguments
- `target` - Files, directories, or entire project to clean
- `--type` - Cleanup type (code, imports, files, all)
- `--safe` - Conservative cleanup (default)
- `--aggressive` - More thorough cleanup with higher risk
- `--dry-run` - Preview changes without applying them

## Execution
1. Analyze target for cleanup opportunities
2. Identify dead code, unused imports, and redundant files
3. Create cleanup plan with risk assessment
4. Execute cleanup operations with appropriate safety measures
5. Validate changes and report cleanup results

## Claude Code Integration
- Uses Glob for systematic file discovery
- Leverages Grep for dead code detection
- Applies MultiEdit for batch cleanup operations
- Maintains backup and rollback capabilities

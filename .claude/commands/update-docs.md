I'll analyze your project's changeset and automatically update user-facing documentation to ensure it stays current with code modifications.

First, let me examine the changes to understand:
1. What files have been modified, added, or removed
2. New features, APIs, or components introduced
3. Breaking changes or deprecated functionality
4. Configuration or setup changes
5. New dependencies or requirements

Then I'll identify and update relevant documentation:
- README.md files
- API documentation
- User guides and tutorials
- Setup/installation instructions
- Configuration documentation
- Changelog/release notes
- Examples and code samples

I'll analyze the following documentation patterns:
- Root README.md
- docs/ directory contents
- Component-level documentation
- API reference files
- Migration guides
- Examples and demos

The process includes:
1. **Change Analysis**: Detect modifications using git diff or file comparison
2. **Documentation Discovery**: Find all user-facing documentation files
3. **Impact Assessment**: Determine which docs need updates based on changes
4. **Content Updates**: Modify documentation to reflect current state
5. **Consistency Check**: Ensure documentation remains coherent and accurate
6. **Validation**: Verify links, examples, and references still work

I'll preserve existing documentation style and structure while ensuring accuracy and completeness.

Let me start by analyzing your recent changes and identifying documentation that needs updates.
